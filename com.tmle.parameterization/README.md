# Passing code with behavior Parameterization
## Problems:
1. Deal with changing requirement
2. Beginning of **Lambda**
3. Real-world examples

## Explains:
### What is _Behavior parameterization_ ?
> Making a block of code available without executing!
### Why we need parameterization ?
> We all know software always change, so the _good_ abstraction is always a good idea.
### When we use parameterization ?
> As much as you can use
### How we can use parameterization?
> First of all, you need a good abstraction then pass it as an argument in the method.
### Where we can use parameterization?
> tbh, the java build in already support that for us.
### Conclusions!
1. Parameterization seems like **strategies design pattern**
2. Passing a block of codes as an argument.
3. With java 8: get rid of the verbosity associated.
4. Save time!
